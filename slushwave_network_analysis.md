## Error Analysis

### Console Errors
1. **Primary Error**: "Error uploading file: FunctionsHttpError: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code"
2. **Timestamp**: 2025-08-20T13:39:41.785Z
3. **Stack Trace**: Located in the application's JavaScript bundle

### Technical Issues Identified

#### 1. Request Body Issue
- The request body is `null`, which indicates the audio file data is not being included in the POST request
- Content-Type is set to `application/json` but no JSON payload is present
- This suggests a potential issue with how the form data or multipart upload is being handled

#### 2. Server Error (500)
- The Supabase Edge Function is returning an internal server error
- Response content length is only 99 bytes, suggesting a short error message
- The error occurs on the server side after receiving the request

#### 3. Authentication
- The request includes both authorization bearer token and API key
- Authentication appears to be properly configured

## Infrastructure Details
- **Platform**: Supabase Edge Functions
- **Runtime**: Deno (indicated by x-deno-execution-id header)
- **Region**: us-east-1
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (indicated by cf-ray header)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Request Body**: The main issue appears to be that the audio file data is not being included in the request body. The form should be sending either:
   - Multipart/form-data with the audio file
   - Base64 encoded file data in the JSON payload

2. **Server-Side Debugging**: The 500 error suggests the Edge Function needs investigation to handle the request properly

3. **Content-Type Header**: Consider using `multipart/form-data` instead of `application/json` for file uploads

4. **Error Handling**: Implement better client-side error handling to provide more descriptive error messages to users
